<h2> About Me</h2>

    



<p>
Hello, my name is Farmouth Dessin, most people call me Mou for short.
I am Haitian-American. Both of my parent was born in Haiti but later came to America to create a better life for themselves as well as my siblings and I. My sibling and I were born here in America. I am a full-time mom, full-time worker, and a student.  Before I turned 30, Iâ€™ve decided to go back to school realizing that I wanted to pave a better life for myself.  I wanted a career that would give me ample opportunities and be placed in environments that would allow me to keep growing.

This is currently my fourth year at NJIT. I am majoring in Information Technology, but my overall goal is to get into Cyber Security. Being that I am in my last year. I do look forward in start my grad program in Cyber Security. There are also some certificate programs that may also be an option for me to get into the Cyber Security world. I am intrigued by this field. I also have other aspirations in life, such as have a few businesses venture ideas that I will like to implement in the near future.

 When I am not working, schooling, or mothering. I am actively seeking my certification as a yoga instructor to teach it more to the youth as part of an organization that I am a part of. I read a lot of books. I enjoy traveling. I am crazy about music and may have a playlist for every genre. I like to workout, go out to eat as well as have great conversations and laughters with my love ones.
